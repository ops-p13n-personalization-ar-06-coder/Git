## Tests/description feedback (solver cannot change tests)
I did not modify tests or descriptions as a solver. The implementation matches the Solution Criteria and preserves existing behaviors. If helpful, the problem can clarify NaN handling or add explicit-categories tie tests; my code already supports these cases via the shared encoder flow.

## Patch apply failure
The patch was generated directly from GitHub compare `<BASE_SHA>...<branch>`. Please try applying again; if it still fails, I can re-generate from the exact SHA you specify.
